# **Selecting a folder**
Tap on the dark green bar to choose a folder or create a new folder.

# **Uploading an image**

Take a photo with the iPad camera and save it in your iPad photo library and then tap “Import Photos” in the app.  (You also can use the camera embedded within the app, although there is an advantage for future access of saving your photos in the photo library.)  In addition to photos, other good images that may be used with this app include illustrations, paintings, advertisements with clear photos, and other commercially-published materials that the language coach, therapist, teacher, or family member already may have. 
We recommend images that show:
<ul>
    <li>The individual in a natural context engaged an activity either by himself/herself or with family, friends, classmates, teachers, pets, etc. </li>
<li>Photos that showcase the individual will provide   an authentic opportunity to use the pronouns “I” and “we”.</li>
<li>To protect student confidentiality, any personal photos stored on a classroom device should be deleted once the students have finished their program or advanced to a higher grade level.</li>
<li>Activities of daily living: washing, dressing, cooking, eating, walking, working, typing.</li>
<li>Complex interactions: baking bread, boarding a bus, attending a party, making a presentation at school.</li> 
<li>Cause-and-effect relationships, either logical or illogical: opening an umbrella when it is raining versus putting on a scarf and mittens on a summer day (if the individual is working on absurdities or on problems and solutions.) </li>
<li>Verb tense sequences: <em>He will peel the potatoes. He is peeling the potatoes. He did peel the potatoes.</em> (Use of “did” avoids problems with learning/recall of irregular past tenses as well as problems with articulation of the inflective ending  “-ed” for regular past tense forms.)</li>
</ul>

# **Creating a sentence**
<ol>
    <li>Select an image, then tap “New Sentence”</li>
    <li>Three blank color tiles will automatically appear on the board. They represent the following:
        (If you don’t want to use the three default tiles to start your sentence, you can “clear” them.) </li>
        <img src = "/assets/tutorialpictures/creatingasentence.jpg" />
    <li>Add words by tapping on a blank tile to show preset choices that you can swap into the tile. Type in your own words by tapping the “+” option.</li>
    <li>Expand your sentence by adding new color tiles to represent different parts of speech.</li>
    <li>Rearrange the words by pressing down on a tile then moving it over.</li>
    <li>Delete a word by double tapping the tile.</li>
    <li>Save sentences by tapping “Submit”. Several sentences can be saved to produce a paragraph.</li>
    <li>Take a screenshot and email the entire page to other teachers or to family members or to print the page for a hard copy.</li>
    <li>Record sentences by tapping the microphone icon. You may then play back the recording.</li>
    <li>Note: Typed sentences can be “saved” for future use; recorded sentences cannot be saved at the present time.</li>
</ol>
